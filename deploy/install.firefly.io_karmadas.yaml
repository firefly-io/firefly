                          version of Kubernetes. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/
                          for details. \n However, Karmada uses Kubernetes Native
                          API definitions for federated resource template, so it doesn't
                          need enable some resource related controllers like daemonset,
                          deployment etc. On the other hand, Karmada leverages the
                          capabilities of the Kubernetes controller to manage the
                          lifecycle of the federated resource, so it needs to enable
                          some controllers. For example, the `namespace` controller
                          is used to manage the lifecycle of the namespace and the
                          `garbagecollector` controller handles automatic clean-up
                          of redundant items in your karmada. \n According to the
                          user feedback and karmada requirements, the following controllers
                          are enabled by default: namespace, garbagecollector, serviceaccount-token,
                          ttl-after-finished, bootstrapsigner,csrapproving,csrcleaner,csrsigning.
                          See https://karmada.io/docs/administrator/configuration/configure-controllers#kubernetes-controllers
                          \n Others are disabled by default. If you want to enable
                          or disable other controllers, you have to explicitly specify
                          all the controllers that kube-controller-manager shoud enable
                          at startup phase."

                                  from a non-empty API group (non core object) or
                                  a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field
                                  is specified, volume binding will only succeed if

                                  they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility,
                                  both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will
                                  be set to the same value automatically if one of

                                  are two important differences between DataSource
                                  and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the
                                  AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.'
